# How to restore a backup of your GitHub repository

After Cloudback created a backup of your GitHub repository, you may need to restore the backup at some point. The page describes the steps that should be taken to restore the backup.

To restore a backup, click on the restore icon on the repository card:

Cloudback uses a separate GitHub application to restore the backups. You can install the application manually using the following [link](https://github.com/apps/cloudback-restore). If the restore application is not installed, you will be asked to do so in the modal window:

</p>

After the restore application was installed, select the repository name where you want to restore the backup. Keep in mind that Cloudback will create a new repository, therefore the repository name should not be taken. Type the repository name and click on the 'Restore' button to start the restore process:

The backup restore will be displayed on the repository card:

After the restore is done, you can use the 'Open restored repository' link to visit the new repository:
